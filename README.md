# MA1 -- Development of XAI Explainable Artificial Intelligence-based framework to Understand Predict and Link Homicides
Criminology and Criminal Profiling have become a requisite component of law enforcement and public safety in the modern age. While profiling is performed by experts who utilize information and knowledge from a crime scene to create a killer's profile, linking these crimes to one another is a complex, challenging, time-consuming, and labor-intensive task. Action and public policy made according to the findings of studies in this field have proven effective and popular. However, efforts to reduce and understand killings havenâ€™t received much of this windfall. Through this project, we encourage students to create a framework for law enforcement that can help close this gap.
